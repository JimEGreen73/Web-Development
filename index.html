        <h1>Learn to become a Web Developer</h1>
    
        <h2>
          This website is my project on the steps I took to learn Web Development
          with my main goals intially to learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript
        </h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="main-para">
        <p>
        When I decided I wanted to learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I was coming from
        a position of knowing very little. I had only really heard of the
        languages as code which built and ran websites look & run like they do and
        my only exsposure to them was when you press the INSPECT ELEMENT on a
        website and you can actually see the code beneath. Like all programming to
        an untrained eye it looks like chaos! However I decided to start looking
        at that chaos in Chrome Developer Mode which anyone can do very easily and
        started playing with the code. Sure most of it I had no idea what it did
        but with some of the basic HTML code I recognised I could easily change it
        and refresh the web page and see what my chnages looked like. Also with
        quick google searches I started learning about Headings, Paragraphs,
        Lists, Div's, basically the core parts of what makes an HTML page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was not only just interested in playing about with web pages but I
          really wanted to learn a new IT skill so that brought me staright to Web
          Development. After I spent a few hours googling Web Development I had
          decided this was defintily for me and I was going to put all my free time
          into it.
        <p/>
        <p>
          However this brought me to my first problem. Where do I start?</p>
        <p>
          You can spend a plethora of hours researching just how to start coding and
          what are the best websites and should I pay for a course as that seems
          like a sensible option, especially for a newbe like me. (More on that in
          Step 1)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Steps outlined in this course, was the process I took from the very
          start to where I am now. I hope by you following this course you will be
          able to start coding quickly and not have to spend time on all the
          research I took when starting out learning about Web Developement. Sure,
          no doubt you are going to be doing researching yourself that is of course
          natural and is also part of the excitment of learning, however by
          following the steps in this course I have already completed the core of
          the research you will need to learn Web Development as these steps contain
          a wealth of knowledge gained by hours of my own research
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it and now it's time to get started. Just follow the steps and your
          be on your way to being a Web Developer!
        </p>
